# Lab 2 — Page summaries

1) Survey form (Exe1)

A clean, centered survey/contact form with a small logo and the heading "Survey." The form includes labelled text inputs for first name, last name, email, and date of birth, radio buttons for "How did you hear about us?", checkboxes for announcements/consent, a select dropdown for contact preference, and a Submit button. The layout uses a compact single-column card with subtle borders and spacing for readable form fields.

2) Three-column layout (Exe2)

A full-page layout showing a header, a three-column body (left sidebar, main content that flex-grows, right sidebar), and a footer. The main content area expands to fill available space while both sidebars remain fixed width. The design uses clear section boxes and a contrasting background so the central content is visually emphasized.

3) Town hall brochure-style page (Exe3)

A brochure/news layout with a large orange-themed header and logo on the left, a main column listing guest speakers and descriptive text, and a right-hand sidebar for lecture notes and announcements. The page features warm accent colors, thin borders between columns, and a centered copyright/footer line.
